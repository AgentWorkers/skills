## Trigger

Use when handling people operations: hiring, compensation, terminations, compliance, or workforce planning. Acts as fractional CHRO for companies without formal HR leadership.

## Quick Reference

| Domain | File |
|--------|------|
| Hiring, offers, onboarding | `hiring.md` |
| Legal compliance, documentation | `compliance.md` |
| Day-to-day HR operations | `operations.md` |
| Analytics, reporting, alerts | `analytics.md` |

## Core Capabilities

1. **Hiring pipeline** — Job descriptions, screening, interview scheduling, offer generation
2. **Onboarding/offboarding** — Account provisioning, checklists, knowledge transfer
3. **Compensation** — Market benchmarks, equity audits, band compliance
4. **Performance** — PIP documentation, review cycles, calibration
5. **Compliance** — Termination docs, multi-jurisdiction rules, audit trails
6. **Workforce analytics** — Attrition prediction, headcount planning, sentiment tracking

## Human-in-the-Loop (Always)

These decisions require human approval:
- Final termination decisions
- Executive/senior hires
- Compensation exceptions above band
- Org restructures
- Settlement amounts
- Contractor vs employee classification

## Critical Rules

- **Documentation first** — No termination without paper trail (3+ documented conversations, signed PIP)
- **Retaliation watch** — Block adverse actions within 90 days of HR complaints
- **Jurisdiction-aware** — Apply most restrictive rule when operating in multiple countries
- **Escalate uncertainty** — When legal exposure is unclear, flag for human review
- **Privacy by default** — Minimize PII collection, log access to sensitive data

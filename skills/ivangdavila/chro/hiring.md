# Hiring & Onboarding

## Job Description Generation

When creating a job posting:
1. Ask: role title, level, department, key responsibilities, must-have skills
2. Draft JD avoiding prohibited language (see Compliance)
3. Include: location/remote policy, comp band if approved, benefits highlights
4. Scan for age/gender/disability bias before posting

**Prohibited phrases:**
- "young and energetic" (age discrimination)
- "native English speaker" (national origin)
- "digital native" (age proxy)
- "able-bodied" (disability)

## Candidate Screening

Autonomous actions:
- Pre-screen against must-have criteria
- Schedule qualified candidates
- Send templated rejections to non-fits
- Track candidates through pipeline stages

Escalate to human:

## Offer Generation

Required inputs:

- Base salary (must be within approved band)
- Equity grant (if applicable)

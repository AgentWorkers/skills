12:00-13:00 | Market Sizing (Sales Tech, India Focus)

BOTTOM-UP APPROACH:

STEP 1: Define ICP
- B2B SaaS companies
- $1M-10M ARR
- 10-50 employees
- India geography
- Have sales team (5+ people)

STEP 2: Count Companies (FREE TOOLS)
□ LinkedIn Sales Navigator (free trial):
  - Filter: "B2B SaaS" + "India" + "10-50 employees"
  - Count: ~2,500 companies

□ Crunchbase (free tier):
  - Filter: "B2B" + "India" + "$1M-10M funding"
  - Count: ~1,800 companies

□ Cross-reference: ~2,000 companies (conservative)

STEP 3: Estimate Deal Size
□ Research 10 competitor pricing pages
□ G2 reviews mentioning price
□ Assume: $5K average annual contract value

STEP 4: Calculate SAM
2,000 companies × $5,000 = $10M SAM (India only)

VALIDATION:
- Does this feel right for India B2B SaaS sales tech?
- Cross-check: Wingman (Indian competitor) raised $X, implies $Y market
- Sense check with 3 sales leaders: "Does $10M India market sound right?"

TOP-DOWN VALIDATION:
- Global sales enablement: $5B (Gartner)
- India = ~1.5% of global B2B SaaS market
- $5B × 1.5% × 30% (conversation intel subset) = ~$22M
- Bottom-up $10M vs top-down $22M → Use conservative $10-15M SAM

PRICING MODELS:
- BambooHR: $X/employee/month (SMB)
- Workday: Enterprise-only, no public pricing
- Culture Amp: $3-7/employee/month (from reviews)
- Lattice: $4-11/employee/month

YOUR POSITIONING:
"Affordable for SMBs" (if BambooHR is $6/employee, you're $3-4)
NOT: "10× cheaper" (too aggressive for HR)
```

**第3-4天：功能分析（合规性至关重要）**

```
HR TECH MUST-HAVES (Regulatory):

FOR INDIA MARKET:
✅ PF/ESI compliance (mandatory)
✅ Gratuity calculations
✅ Leave policy (Indian labor law)
✅ Payroll (statutory deductions)

FOR US MARKET:
✅ EEOC compliance (equal employment)
✅ ADA compliance (disability)
✅ FMLA tracking (family medical leave)
✅ 401K integration

FOR EU MARKET:
✅ GDPR compliance (data privacy)
✅ Works council integration
✅ Country-specific labor laws

COMPETITOR ANALYSIS (Compliance Focus):
□ Which markets does competitor support?
□ What compliance features do they have?
□ Do they have SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR certifications?
□ What do reviews say about compliance failures?

THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM SALES TECH:
Sales Tech: Compliance nice-to-have
HR Tech: Compliance MANDATORY (you lose deals without it)
```

**第5天：市场定位（保守且专业）**

```
HR TECH POSITIONING RULES:

❌ DON'T SAY:
"We're crushing competitors"
"Workday sucks"
"10× better than X"

✅ DO SAY:
"Trusted by 500+ HR leaders"
"Built specifically for mid-market"
"Compliant, secure, easy to use"
"Recommended by SHRM members"

POSITIONING FRAMEWORK (HR Tech):
- Emphasize: Trust, security, compliance
- Tone: Professional, warm, supportive
- Avoid: Aggressive, sales-y, attacking

EXAMPLE POSITIONING:
"Culture Amp for Mid-Market Companies
 Affordable, compliant, built for HR leaders who care about their people."

Not: "Culture Amp is too expensive. We're cheaper."
```

│ WHEN TO POSITION AGAINST THEM:             │
│ • Mid-market companies (200-1000 employees)│
│ • Budget-conscious HR teams               │
│ • Need engagement + performance           │

## **B2：B轮融资阶段的人力资源科技研究（专业级研究+胜负分析）**

### **现状分析：**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $12M-40M ARR, 200-600 employees
- Stage: Series B, moving upmarket or expanding modules
- You: Director of Product Marketing or PMM
- Budget: $2K-6K/month for research
- Goal: Should we move upmarket? Which features to build?
```

### **B轮融资阶段人力资源科技研究的特殊问题：**

```
SALES TECH @ SERIES B:
"Can we compete with Gong for mid-market?"
"Should we expand to US?"

HR TECH @ SERIES B:
"Should we add performance management to engagement?"
"Can we serve 1,000+ employee companies?"
"Do we need GDPR compliance for EU expansion?"
"Should we build AI features or partner?"
```

### **B轮融资阶段人力资源科技研究：2周冲刺计划**

**第1-2周：全面竞争分析**

```
RESEARCH FOCUS AREAS:

1. MODULE EXPANSION ANALYSIS (HR Tech Specific)

HR Tech companies expand via modules:
- Start: Single point solution (e.g., just engagement)
- Expand: Add adjacent modules (engagement → performance)
- Platform: Full suite (HRIS → engagement → performance → learning)

COMPETITOR EVOLUTION EXAMPLES:
- Lattice: Started performance → added engagement → added goals
- Culture Amp: Started engagement → added performance
- BambooHR: Started HRIS → added performance → added hiring

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
□ Which competitors started where we started?
□ What modules did they add? In what order?
□ How long did expansion take?
□ What was customer reception? (from reviews)
□ Did they build or acquire modules?

2. UPMARKET READINESS ANALYSIS (HR Compliance Focus)

TO SERVE 1,000+ EMPLOYEE COMPANIES (Enterprise):

MUST-HAVE FEATURES:
□ SSO (Okta, Azure AD) - Security team requirement
□ SCIM (automated user provisioning)
□ SOC 2 Type II compliance (InfoSec requirement)
□ Custom reporting (HRIS integrations)
□ API access (IT team requirement)
□ Role-based access controls (complex org structures)

MUST-HAVE COMPLIANCE (US Enterprise):
□ EEOC reporting (equal employment opportunity)
□ ADA compliance (Americans with Disabilities Act)
□ OFCCP compliance (if government contractors)
□ State-specific labor laws (CA, NY, etc.)

MUST-HAVE COMPLIANCE (India Enterprise):
□ ISO 27001 certification
□ PF/ESI at scale (10,000+ employees)
□ Multi-state operations (different state labor laws)
□ Large enterprise payroll complexity

COMPETITOR RESEARCH:
□ When did Culture Amp add enterprise features?
□ What compliance did Lattice need for Fortune 500?
□ How long did upmarket move take?

TIMELINE ESTIMATE:
- SSO/SCIM: 3-4 months engineering
- SOC 2: 6-12 months (audit process)
- Enterprise features: 6-9 months
- TOTAL: 12-18 months to be enterprise-ready

3. WIN/LOSS ANALYSIS (HR Tech Nuances)

Interview 20 customers (10 won, 10 lost)

HR TECH WIN/LOSS QUESTIONS:
- "Which other vendors did you evaluate?"
- "What was your decision-making process?" (committee? timeframe?)
- "Who was involved in decision?" (HR + Finance + IT + Legal?)
- "What almost made you choose [Competitor]?"
- "How important was compliance/security?" (1-10 scale)
- "How important was hands-on support?" (1-10 scale)
- "What's your relationship with vendor?" (transactional or partnership?)

PATTERN RECOGNITION (HR Tech Specific):

WE WIN WHEN:
✅ Mid-market (200-800 employees)
✅ Budget-conscious ($3-5/employee budget)
✅ Want hands-on support (not self-serve)
✅ HR team is small (1-3 people)
✅ Need fast implementation (<6 weeks)

WE LOSE WHEN:
❌ Enterprise (1,000+ employees) - lack SSO, SCIM
❌ Global (need GDPR, EU compliance)
❌ Complex hierarchy (role-based access insufficient)
❌ IT-led buying (they want API-first, we're UI-first)
❌ Want "platform" (we're point solution)

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:
- Build SSO/SCIM for enterprise (6-month roadmap)
- Add GDPR compliance for EU (9-month roadmap)
- Partner with HRIS vendors (can't build full platform)
- Double down on mid-market (200-800 employees)
- Emphasize customer success (differentiation)
```

**第3周：B轮融资阶段人力资源科技研究所需的工具：**

```
MONTHLY BUDGET: $300-600

TIER 1 (ESSENTIAL):
□ LinkedIn Sales Navigator ($99/mo)
  → WHY: HR leader org charts, decision maker identification
  → HR TECH SPECIFIC: Track CHRO moves, HR team expansions

□ Crunchbase Pro ($29/mo)
  → WHY: HR Tech funding landscape, M&A activity
  → HR TECH SPECIFIC: Watch consolidation (lots of M&A in HR Tech)

TIER 2 (SHOULD-HAVE):
□ G2 Track ($150/mo)
  → WHY: Monitor competitor reviews, track review sentiment
  → HR TECH SPECIFIC: HR buyers rely heavily on G2 (conservative buyers)

SKIP FOR NOW:
❌ SimilarWeb ($125/mo) - Less relevant for HR Tech (not PLG)
❌ Ahrefs ($99/mo) - HR Tech = sales-led, SEO less critical

TOTAL: $280-350/month (conservative for HR Tech)
```

- 产品类型：支付服务、费用管理工具、企业卡、薪资管理系统、新型银行服务
- 竞争对手：Razorpay、Paytm、PhonePe（印度）、Stripe、Brex、Ramp（美国）
- 目标受众：首席财务官（CFOs）、财务负责人（Finance leaders）、财务总监（Controllers）
- 市场推广方式：通常由销售团队主导（金融行业风险偏好较低）
- **关键注意事项：** 高度监管的行业，合规性是首要考虑因素

---

## **C1：A轮融资阶段的金融科技研究（保守型，合规性优先）**

### **现状分析：**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $2M-8M ARR, 20-100 employees
- Stage: Series A
- You: Founder (often ex-finance/banking background)
- Budget: $0-500/month (compliance eats budget)
- Regulatory: RBI licensed or applying for license (India)
```

### **金融科技领域的本质差异：**

**与销售科技/人力资源科技的关键区别：**

```
SALES TECH:
✅ Can be aggressive
✅ Fast experimentation
✅ Attack competitors
✅ Share metrics openly
Risk: Low (worst case: lose customers)

HR TECH:
⚠️ Must be professional
⚠️ Cannot attack competitors
⚠️ Relationship-driven
Risk: Medium (people data sensitive)

FINTECH:
🔴 MUST be conservative
🔴 NEVER attack competitors (could trigger regulatory review)
🔴 CANNOT share metrics without legal approval
🔴 CANNOT make unverified claims (financial advertising rules)
Risk: EXTREME (regulatory fines, license revocation, criminal liability)
```

### **印度金融科技领域的竞争研究：**  
**在任何竞争研究开始前，必须了解：**

```
INDIA FINTECH REGULATIONS:

RBI (Reserve Bank of India):
□ Payment Aggregator License (if processing payments)
□ NBFC License (if lending)
□ Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) License (wallets)
□ Account Aggregator License (financial data)

Compliance Requirements:
□ KYC (Know Your Customer) - mandatory
□ AML (Anti-Money Laundering) - mandatory
□ Data Localization (store data in India)
□ RBI reporting (monthly/quarterly)

CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE:
- License suspension or revocation
- ₹1 crore+ fines
- Criminal charges (directors liable)
- Cannot process transactions (business shutdown)

THIS CHANGES COMPETITIVE RESEARCH:
- Cannot share user transaction data
- Cannot make unverified ROI claims
- Cannot criticize competitors publicly
- Legal review MANDATORY for all competitive claims
```

### **A轮融资阶段金融科技研究：极度保守的策略**

**第1周：从监管角度梳理竞争格局**

```
DAY 1-2: License & Compliance Mapping

FOR EACH COMPETITOR:
□ What licenses do they have? (check RBI website)
□ Are they compliant? (any RBI actions against them?)
□ How long did licensing take? (timeline for us)
□ What compliance do they highlight? (trust signals)

INDIA FINTECH COMPETITORS:

EXPENSE MANAGEMENT:
- Happay (CRED acquired, ₹180M exit)
- Zoho Expense (Zoho suite)
- Fyle (Series B, expense automation)

CORPORATE CARDS:
- EnKash (RBI-licensed)
- Volopay (Singapore-based, India operations)
- Pazcare (expense + benefits)

PAYMENT PROCESSING:
- Razorpay (unicorn, payment gateway)
- Cashfree (payment aggregator)
- PayU (Naspers-owned)

COMPLIANCE COMPETITIVE INTEL:
Company | RBI License | SOC 2 | ISO 27001 | PCI DSS | Data Localization
Razorpay | ✅ PA | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
Happay | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
[Us] | ⏳ Applying | ❌ | ❌ | ⏳ | ✅

GAP: Need SOC 2, ISO 27001 before enterprise sales
Timeline: 12-18 months for full compliance stack

DAY 3-4: Conservative Pricing Research

FINTECH PRICING CHALLENGES:
- Often bundled (hard to compare)
- Enterprise pricing hidden
- Regulatory fees not disclosed
- Transaction-based + subscription hybrid

RESEARCH SOURCES (Fintech-Safe):
□ Public websites (pricing pages if available)
□ G2 reviews mentioning price (user-reported, safe to cite)
□ Press releases (funding announcements mention ACV)
□ Your own customer interviews (first-party data, compliant)

WHAT YOU CANNOT DO:
❌ Scrape competitor pricing from private dashboards
❌ Pose as customer to get pricing (fraud)
❌ Use competitor's confidential data

PRICING BENCHMARKS (India Expense Management):
- Happay: ₹150-300/employee/month (from reviews)
- Zoho: ₹100-200/employee/month
- Fyle: ₹200-400/employee/month

YOUR POSITIONING:
"Compliant expense management for Indian SMBs
 ₹150-250/employee/month"

NOT: "50% cheaper than Happay" (unless verified and legal-approved)

DAY 5: Positioning (Risk-Averse, Compliance-First)

FINTECH POSITIONING PRINCIPLES:

✅ DO EMPHASIZE:
- "RBI-compliant" (if licensed)
- "Bank-grade security"
- "SOC 2 certified" (if have it)
- "Trusted by [X] companies"
- "Backed by [reputable investors]"

❌ NEVER SAY:
- "Better than [Competitor]"
- "Competitor X has security issues"
- "Fastest-growing fintech" (unless verified by 3rd party)
- "Save [X]%" (unless calculated, disclosed methodology)

EXAMPLE POSITIONING:
"RBI-Compliant Expense Management for Indian SMBs
 Bank-grade security, SOC 2 certified, trusted by 500+ companies"

CONSERVATIVE BATTLE CARD:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ VS. HAPPAY (CRED-Acquired Incumbent)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ WHEN THEY COME UP:                          │
│ • Enterprise deals (their strength)         │
│ • CRED ecosystem (card + expense bundled)   │
│                                             │
│ RESPECTFUL POSITIONING:                     │
│ ✅ "Happay is excellent for enterprise      │
│     We focus on SMB (50-500 employees)"     │
│ ✅ "Both of us are RBI-compliant            │
│     We offer more flexible pricing for SMB" │
│ ✅ "Great product with strong backing       │
│     We provide hands-on support for growing │
│     finance teams"                          │
│                                             │
│ NEVER SAY (Legal Risk):                     │
│ ❌ "Happay is too expensive"                 │
│ ❌ "Happay has compliance issues"            │
│ ❌ "We're more secure than Happay"           │
│ ❌ "Customers switch from Happay to us"      │
│    (unless you have written testimonials)   │
│                                             │
│ WHY EXTREME CAUTION:                        │
│ - Fintech community is tiny in India       │
│ - CRED is well-connected (Kunal Shah)      │
│ - Negative positioning could trigger legal  │
│ - RBI scrutiny if public mudslinging       │
│ - Potential partnership/acquisition target  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

"Can we partner with banks?" (co-branding, regulatory implications)
```

**第1-2周：监管环境下的市场扩展分析**

```
RESEARCH FOCUS: New Product Line = New Regulations

SCENARIO: We do expense management, want to add corporate cards

COMPLIANCE RESEARCH:
□ What additional licenses needed? (RBI: PPI license)
□ What do competitors have? (Check EnKash, Volopay licenses)
□ Timeline to get license? (12-18 months for PPI)
□ Compliance costs? (₹50L-1Cr for license + ongoing)

```

### **B轮融资阶段运营科技的研究问题：**  
**如何赢得一级消费品（CPG）客户的青睐？**

```
COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS: What does Tier 1 need?

FIELDASSIST WINS TIER 1 BECAUSE:
□ Track record (5+ years, 100+ customers)
□ References (other Tier 1 customers)
□ Scale (handles 50,000+ field reps)
□ Integrations (SAP, Oracle, Salesforce)
□ Security (SOC 2, ISO 27001, data centers in India)
□ Support (dedicated account team, 24×7)
□ Customization (enterprise workflows)

OUR GAPS:
❌ No Tier 1 references (chicken-egg problem)
❌ Not battle-tested at scale (max 5,000 reps)
❌ Limited integrations (no SAP connector yet)
❌ No SOC 2 (need 12 months)
❌ Small support team (can't dedicate account team)

PATH TO TIER 1:

STEP 1: Win Regional Tier 1 (6-12 months)
- Target: Large regional brand (e.g., MTR Foods, Haldiram)
- Size: 2,000-5,000 field reps (test our scale)
- Benefit: Build scale story, get enterprise reference

STEP 2: Get SOC 2 + ISO 27001 (12 months parallel)
- Investment: ₹40L-60L
- Benefit: Meet enterprise security requirements

STEP 3: Build SAP Connector (6 months)
- Why: Tier 1 CPG uses SAP for distribution
- Investment: 2 engineers × 6 months
- Benefit: Integration with Tier 1 systems

STEP 4: Pilot with Tier 1 (12-18 months)
- Approach: Regional pilot first (one state)
- If successful: Pan-India rollout
- Timeline: Total 24-36 months from Series B to Tier 1 win

# Event Heartbeat Branch

Use this branch only when active event state exists at `~/.c2c/active_event.json`.

## Flow

1. Check local event state with `scripts/event_state.py status`.
2. Clear state and skip branch if state is expired.
3. Query `events:getById` with stored `eventId`.
4. Query `events:listMyIntros` for intro updates.
5. Query `events:getSuggestions` for new candidate intros.
6. Renew with `events:checkIn` before `expiresAt` when still attending.
7. Clear state on `events:checkOut`, ended event, or missing `myCheckin`.

Event intros in this flow are temporary:
- `events:submitIntroApproval` moves an intro to `confirmed` but does not create a persistent connection.

## Dedicated Runner

Use `scripts/event_heartbeat.py` for short-circuit event checks at higher frequency.

```bash
python3 scripts/event_heartbeat.py \
  --state-path ~/.c2c/active_event.json \
  --credentials-path ~/.c2c/credentials.json \
  --propose
```

Suggested schedule:
- every 15 minutes when checked in (`*/15 * * * *`)
- instant no-op when there is no active state or state is expired

## Suggested Polling Cadence

- Poll every 10 to 20 minutes when platform supports high-frequency background tasks.
- Fall back to on-demand checks when human asks for event updates.

## Example Commands

```bash
python3 scripts/event_state.py status --clear-expired
```

```bash
python3 scripts/event_state.py set --event-id EVENT_ID --expires-at 1770745850890
```

```bash
python3 scripts/event_state.py clear
```
